Notebooks for running gromacs on colab

## Run on Colab (free)

To run these resources on Colab, a Google gmail account is required.  As of 6/6/2025, gmail accounts provide access to Colab as well as Google Drive.

To run a Gromacs tutorial of protein simulation, scaffolded in a Jupyter notebook on Colab, open the notebook "GMX_FirstTutorial" using this link:
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/mkubasik/gmx_on_colab/blob/main/GMX_FirstTutorial.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

This notebook will load and position precompiled gromacs binaries on a Colab instance running metered T4 GPU acceration.  If the command "gmx --version" of the notebook fails to provide output, then Gromacs is not installed properly.  Two options:

* Please try again...sometimes Google's resources fail to perform on a first try.
* Alternatively, it is possible updates to the Colab ecosystem are incompatible with the posted binaries.  If you suspect an incompatibility, the notebook "Compile_Gromacs..." may be downloaded to recompile Gromacs.  It may take an hour or more to compile Gromacs on Colab, consuming a great deal of a day's free GPU access.
  A notebook to compile Gromacs on a T4 instance of Google's colab,according to the "Installation...Quick and Dirty Install", is linked here:
